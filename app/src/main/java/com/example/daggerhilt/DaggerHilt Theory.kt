/*

    * Dagger Hilt Theory *
# All apps that use Hilt must contain an Application class that is annotated with @HiltAndroidApp.

# There is no need to create components, that will be handled by the Hilt itself.

# In case of application class we annotate the class with @HiltAndroidApp and for rest of the classes
we use @AndroidEntryPoint.
